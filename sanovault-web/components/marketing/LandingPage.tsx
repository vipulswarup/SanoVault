  {
    question: "What is a personal health record?",

      "A personal health record (PHR) is a health history you keep yourself. It can include reports, prescriptions and notes from different doctors, hospitals and labs — not only what one hospital system stores.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I keep medical records for my family?",
    answer:
      "Yes. SanoVault uses a family folder. You can add people in your household and invite other adults to that folder. Members can see the people and records in it, so invite only those who should have access.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I upload old medical reports?",
    answer:
      "Yes. You can upload PDFs and photos, and scan paper reports with your phone camera. That includes older files you already have on your phone or computer.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I keep records from different hospitals?",
    answer:
      "Yes. SanoVault is not tied to one hospital. You add the reports you have, whoever issued them.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I share a record with a doctor?",
    answer:
      "You can send a time-limited link for a specific document, or take a one-page summary and a medicine list to the appointment. There is no public profile.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is SanoVault connected to ABHA?",
    answer:
      "No. SanoVault does not currently fetch records from ABHA or ABDM. You can optionally save an ABHA number on a person's profile. Records in SanoVault are ones you add yourself. ABHA is India's health ID under the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission; not every past report will be available there.",
  },
  {
    question: "What kinds of medical documents can I store?",
    answer:
      "Lab reports, prescriptions, imaging reports, discharge summaries, vaccination records, and other files you upload. You can also keep a medicine list and log blood pressure.",
