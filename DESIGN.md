# Design and interaction rules

Decisions shared by the website and the mobile app. If a screen disagrees with this file, the screen is wrong (or this file needs updating in the same change).

Tokens live in code: web in `sanovault-web/app/globals.css`, mobile in `sanovault-mobile/lib/theme/sv_colors.dart`. Keep the two in sync.

## Palette: clouded blue, peach and soft greys

Based on the shared reference. Use the six reference swatches for the visual identity and darker derived shades where small text needs more contrast.

| Token | Hex | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| brand | `#1E76F7` | Clouded Blue: accents, charts, focus rings |
| brand-strong / primaryButton | `#165FCF` | Primary buttons, links, selected tabs; accessible white labels |
| brand-tint | `#E8F0FF` | Selected rows, chips, secondary button fill |
| ink | `#362F2F` | Night Rider: body text |
| slate | `#625D66` | Secondary text, inactive icons |
| silver | `#CDD1D9` | Naturally Calm: dividers and borders |
| background | `#F3F2F3` | Aragonite White: page background |
| surface | `#FFFFFF` | Cards, sheets, bars |
| peach / warning-tint | `#F4999D` | Peach Burst: review badges and highlights, with dark text |
| highlighter-red | `#E44B58` | Highlighter Red: chart highlights and status accents |
| danger / danger-tint | `#B22B3C` / `#FDEBEE` | Readable error text, destructive actions, readings flagged high |
| success | `#165FCF` | Saved confirmations, with explicit success labels or icons |

On the website, Tailwind neutral, blue/indigo, red/rose/amber and green/emerald utility scales follow this palette in `globals.css`. Semantic statuses retain their labels and icons. HeroUI uses the same surface, accent and status tokens. Prefer named tokens in new code, and do not introduce new hard-coded colours. Native mobile themes and web browser chrome use the same palette.

## Navigation

Mobile tabs, in order: **Home · Reports · Log · Medicines · More**.

- **Home**: one card per person with *Log Symptom* and *Log BP*, recent reports, invites. *Prepare doctor packet* is a quiet text link, not a primary button.
- **Reports**: the one place to add a report (the "+" in the title bar) and to browse them. The phone share sheet also files reports.
- **Log**: quick entry for a symptom or note, blood pressure, height and weight, a medicine, or a report.
- **More**: people, families and sharing, blood pressure, height and weight, vaccinations, symptoms and notes, doctor packet, privacy, AI processing, account.

The website mirrors this: bottom bar Home · Reports · Log · Medicines on narrow screens, with the full list in the menu.

Rules:

1. **Symptom logging is never more than one tap from Home or the tab bar.**
2. **No per-person "Add a report" buttons.** Reports are added from the Reports area only.
3. The doctor packet is important but occasional; it must not compete with logging.
4. Folder Check (Mac) is the only Mac-specific entry and lives under More.

## Lists and ordering

- **Reports**: newest *document* date first (upload date only when the document has none). Mobile groups by month.
- **Symptoms and notes**: newest first by note date, then by time added, grouped under date headers. No pinning.
- **Blood pressure**: newest reading first, with the latest marked.
- Logged items (symptom notes, blood-pressure readings) can be **edited and deleted**. Items saved offline cannot be changed until they have synced, and the app says so.

## Speed and offline behaviour

- A form must be usable immediately. Never block an entry form on a list fetch.
- Lists show the on-device cache first, then refresh quietly; show a spinner only when there is nothing cached.
- The people list is shared by every screen (one in-memory store, cache first), not fetched per screen.
- Background work (prefetching records, downloading files) waits so it never competes with what the person just tapped.
- Server work done on behalf of a share or upload is asynchronous; the app confirms as soon as the file is stored.

## Content

- Labels are plain and family-friendly: "Symptoms & Notes", "Doctor packet", "Who Can See This".
- Validation messages state the allowed range (for example blood pressure systolic 50–250 mmHg). High readings are coloured, not diagnosed.
- Report details show an AI summary for practitioners of at most 200 words, followed by the original file by default. Every PDF page must be viewable on web and mobile. Summary and file loading fail independently; never substitute raw OCR text for a summary.
- Medical terms and extracted values are shown as read from the document; the app never silently invents a value.

## Accessibility

- Text and controls meet WCAG AA contrast with the palette above (white on the primary action blue (`#165FCF`) exceeds 4.5:1).
- Interactive targets are at least 44 pt tall.
- Selection is shown by more than colour (a check mark or label).
- Known gaps (tracked in the mobile PLAN): few explicit screen-reader labels, and large-text layouts have not been audited.
